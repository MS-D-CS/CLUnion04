            <p><strong>Curbside Thai</strong> brings the rich flavor of Thailand to 
                North Carolina. Master Chef Sajja Adulet, with over 35 
                years of experience at the House of Asia, now offers 
                that same fine dining to the streets of Charlotte 
                with our modern mobile food truck.</p>
                
                <p>This is not bland vendor food packaged in greasy 
                paper boxes! Sample his acclaimed cuisine at our various 
                mobile locations throughout downtown Charlotte from 
                11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Monday through Thursday, and 
                11 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. Taste the 
                difference! If you can't get away from your desk, 
                <em>Curbside Thai will deliver.</em></p>
